CVE-2006-20001 Imagine your computer is like a library with lots of books (which are like the information it stores). Now, there's a special way to ask for a book. But if someone asks in a very sneaky way, it can accidentally make the librarian (the computer) place a bookmark (a tiny piece of data) in the wrong book or the wrong page. This might seem small, but it can confuse the librarian so much that they might trip and drop all the books, messing up the whole library! This problem happens in a computer program that's like the librarian for websites. It's called the Apache HTTP Server. This sneaky question issue happens in all the versions before 2.4.54. So, if you're using this program for your websites, you need to update it to a newer, fixed version. This is like training your librarian to not get tricked by sneaky questions, keeping your website library neat and running smoothly.
CVE-2013-5704 Imagine your computer is a mailroom where letters (which are like the data it receives) are sorted. In this mailroom, there's a rule to throw away any letters with a certain kind of sticker on them. However, there's a trick some people use: they put the sticker not on the front of the letter, but on the back, in a section that's not usually checked. So, these letters end up not being thrown away and get sorted with the rest, even though they're not supposed to. This issue is found in a program called Apache HTTP Server, version 2.2.22, which is like the mailroom for websites. It has this rule for throwing away certain data, but because of the trick with the sticker placement, some data that should be discarded gets through. The people who make this program say that this isn't really a big safety issue, but it's like having a loophole in how the mailroom sorts letters. If you use this version for your website, just be aware that this little trick might let some things slip through the sorting rule.
CVE-2013-6438 Imagine your computer has a special robot (part of a program) that helps organize and understand messages it receives. Now, these messages are supposed to be neat and tidy, without any unnecessary spaces or blank lines. But there's a problem with this robot in a version of a program called Apache HTTP Server, which is used to manage websites. In versions before 2.4.8, this robot doesn't do a good job cleaning up these messages. It leaves in extra spaces and blank lines. Now, if someone sends a message that's purposely messy with lots of extra spaces, the robot gets overwhelmed trying to clean it up. It's like giving someone a puzzle with too many pieces â€“ they just can't solve it and give up. This mess can cause the robot, and thus the server managing the websites, to stop working. It's like the puzzle-solver walking away in frustration, leaving the puzzle (or in this case, the website) unfinished. This is called a denial of service, as the website can't provide its service to people anymore. If you're using an older version of this program, it's important to update it so your website's organizing robot can handle these messy messages without getting overwhelmed.
CVE-2014-0098 This problem relates to Apache HTTP Server which acts like a faulty mailbox that breaks when it receives a weirdly shaped letter. Specifically, there's a part of the server that keeps a record of who visits the website, but it can't handle certain types of information sent by visitors (in this case, a "cookie" or a small piece of data). If someone sends a specially made cookie, it confuses this part of the server, causing it to crash and temporarily shut down the website. The solution is to update the server software to a newer version that knows how to handle these tricky cookies without crashing. This is like replacing the faulty mailbox with a new one that can handle all shapes and sizes of mail.
CVE-2014-0117 This issue is like a glitch in a traffic control system for a busy road. In the Apache HTTP Server, a component called mod_proxy, which acts like a traffic controller for data, has a weakness in versions before 2.4.10. When set up to direct incoming traffic to different parts of the server (reverse proxy), this component can be tricked by a sneaky, abnormal request disguised as a regular 'traffic signal' (a crafted HTTP Connection header). This fake signal can confuse the traffic controller, causing it to crash, which is similar to the traffic lights going out and causing disruptions. To fix this, you should update your Apache HTTP Server to version 2.4.10 or newer. This is like upgrading the traffic control system to recognize and handle these sneaky signals without breaking down.
CVE-2014-0118 This issue in the Apache HTTP Server is like having a faulty air pump that's supposed to inflate balloons to a specific size. The mod_deflate module in versions before 2.4.10 has a function, like an air pump, that's responsible for decompressing (or inflating) certain data received by the server. However, this function has a problem: when it receives specially crafted data (like an oddly-shaped balloon), it ends up using a lot more resources than expected to decompress this data (inflating the balloon too much). This can overload the server, similar to how an air pump might overheat if it tries to inflate too many balloons too quickly. The solution is to update the server to version 2.4.10 or newer, which is like getting a better air pump that can handle these odd requests without overworking.
CVE-2014-0226 This issue in the Apache HTTP Server is akin to a security flaw in a busy office building's sign-in system. In versions before 2.4.10, the mod_status module, which monitors and reports on server activity, has a race condition. This is like having two employees trying to update the same visitor log at the same time, leading to confusion and mistakes. An attacker can exploit this by sending a special request, causing the system to get mixed up. This mix-up can lead to server crashes or, in worse cases, give attackers access to sensitive information or control over the server. The solution is to update the server software to version 2.4.10 or later, which is like improving the sign-in system to handle multiple updates smoothly and securely.
CVE-2014-0231 The issue with the mod_cgid module in Apache HTTP Server versions before 2.4.10 is like a restaurant kitchen without a timer for its orders. Normally, the module helps run scripts on the server, akin to a kitchen preparing different dishes. However, it lacks a timer (timeout mechanism), so if a script (like an order) doesn't start correctly and just waits indefinitely (like a chef waiting for an ingredient that never arrives), it can cause the whole process to hang or get stuck. This can slow down or stop the server from working, similar to the kitchen being unable to prepare any more meals. The fix is to update the server software to version 2.4.10 or later, which adds a timer to prevent such hang-ups, like introducing kitchen timers to keep the orders moving efficiently.
CVE-2014-3581 The issue in the Apache HTTP Server's mod_cache module before version 2.4.11 is similar to a sorting machine that malfunctions when it encounters an empty box. This module is designed to store and manage website data for quick access, but it has a flaw. When it receives a request with an empty "Content-Type" header (like an empty box), it doesn't know what to do with it. This confusion can cause the server to crash, similar to how the sorting machine would stop working when it can't process an empty box. The solution is to update the Apache HTTP Server to version 2.4.11 or later, which is like fixing the sorting machine so it can handle empty boxes without breaking down.
CVE-2014-8109 The issue in the mod_lua module in Apache HTTP Server 2.3.x and 2.4.x up to 2.4.10 is like a security system in a building that gets confused when given different instructions for similar situations. This module, which uses Lua scripts for tasks like authorizing access to parts of a website, doesn't handle scenarios where the same script is given different rules for different areas. It's like having a security system that's told to allow only Group A into one room and only Group B into another, but it gets mixed up and lets the wrong group into a room. This can lead to unauthorized access. The fix is to update the server to a version after 2.4.10, which is like updating the security system to correctly understand and enforce different access rules for different groups in different areas.
CVE-2015-0228 The problem in the Apache HTTP Server's mod_lua module through version 2.4.12 is like a communication system in an office that crashes when it receives an unexpected type of message. The module, which uses Lua scripts, can handle certain types of data exchanges (WebSocket communications), but there's a flaw when a Lua script upgrades the communication channel (wsupgrade function). If, after this upgrade, the server receives a specially crafted 'Ping' message, it's like the system getting a message in a format it can't process, causing it to crash. This can disrupt services. The solution is to update the server to a version after 2.4.12, which can be thought of as updating the communication system to handle these unexpected message types without crashing.
CVE-2015-3183 The issue in the Apache HTTP Server before version 2.4.14 is like a mailroom in an office that incorrectly sorts packages based on their size labels. The server's method of handling data chunks (pieces of data) is flawed. It doesn't correctly understand the size labels (chunk headers) of these data chunks, especially if they're unusually large or have odd characters. This can lead to confusion in how data is processed, similar to how misreading package labels might lead to misplaced mail. Attackers can exploit this confusion to sneak in harmful requests mixed with normal data. The solution is to update to version 2.4.14 or later, which is akin to training the mailroom staff to correctly interpret all types of size labels and sort packages accurately.
CVE-2015-3185 The problem in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.x before 2.4.14 is similar to a security protocol in an office building that fails to distinguish between different types of security badges. The server's function (ap_some_auth_required) does not properly differentiate between settings for entering (authentication) and permissions within (authorization). This is like a security system that checks if someone has any badge at all, without verifying if the badge grants access to specific areas. Attackers could exploit this by using any general access badge to enter restricted areas. The fix in version 2.4.14 is akin to updating the security protocol to check not just for a badge, but for the right kind of badge that grants specific access permissions.
CVE-2015-5352 The issue in OpenSSH before version 6.9 relates to its handling of X11 forwarding, a method for securely forwarding graphical user interface applications. Specifically, there's a lapse in the function that opens X11 connections. It's like a security guard who forgets to check the expiration time on visitor passes. In scenarios where the less secure "ForwardX11Trusted" mode isn't used, this lapse means the system fails to properly enforce the time window during which connections are allowed. As a result, attackers could potentially connect to the system outside of the permitted time, bypassing security restrictions. Updating to OpenSSH version 6.9 or later fixes this oversight, similar to retraining the security guard to always check the expiration time on passes.

As a result, attackers could potentially connect to the system outside of the permitted time, bypassing security restrictions. Updating to OpenSSH version 6.9 or later fixes this oversight, similar to retraining the security guard to always check the expiration time on passes.
CVE-2015-5600 The issue in OpenSSH through version 6.9 involves its handling of multiple password prompts during a single connection. Imagine a security checkpoint that allows a visitor to try many different keys to open a door, without restrictions. In this case, OpenSSH's function for handling keyboard-interactive authentication (kbdint_next_device) doesn't limit the number of password attempts a user can make in one go. An attacker could exploit this by repeatedly trying different passwords, either to guess the correct one (brute-force attack) or to overload the system (denial of service). Updating to a version after 6.9 is like adding a rule at the security checkpoint to limit the number of key tries, preventing misuse.
CVE-2015-6563 The vulnerability in OpenSSH before version 7.0, specifically in the monitor component on non-OpenBSD platforms, is akin to a security system in an office that accidentally allows employees to wear someone else's ID badge. The issue lies in how extra username data is accepted in certain requests. This flaw can be exploited by someone who already has basic access to the SSH system. They could manipulate the system to impersonate another user by sending a special type of request with altered username information. Updating to OpenSSH version 7.0 or later is like fixing the security system to ensure it verifies the identity on each badge accurately, preventing such impersonation.
CVE-2015-6564 The use-after-free vulnerability in OpenSSH before 7.0 on non-OpenBSD platforms, specifically in the mm_answer_pam_free_ctx function, is like a scenario where an office worker is able to use a discarded access card to gain unauthorized privileges. In this case, after the initial use of a security feature (like a badge or keycard), it is supposed to be deactivated. However, due to this flaw, a user with basic access to the SSH system (like an employee with a standard access card) could exploit this oversight. By sending a request at an unexpected time, they could gain higher access privileges, similar to using a discarded card to enter a restricted area. Updating to OpenSSH version 7.0 or later fixes this, ensuring that once a security feature is used, it can't be exploited again.
CVE-2016-0736 The vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.23 involves mod_session_crypto, a module that encrypts session data. Think of it as a faulty lock on a safe. The module was using encryption methods (like CBC mode) that weren't completely secure, making it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. This is like having a safe that could be manipulated to open without the correct combination. These attacks could potentially let attackers decrypt the data. The fix is to use more secure encryption methods, similar to replacing the faulty lock with a more secure one that can't be easily manipulated.
CVE-2016-2161 In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.23, there's a flaw in mod_auth_digest, a module used for user authentication. Imagine this as a door lock that malfunctions when a wrong key is used. If a user provides incorrect or malicious input, it can cause the server to crash, similar to the lock jamming and the door becoming unusable. Furthermore, even after the initial issue, the server continues to crash for subsequent valid attempts, akin to the door remaining jammed even with the correct key. The solution is to update the server to a version that handles these inputs more gracefully, like fixing the lock to prevent it from jamming.
CVE-2016-4975 In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.1 to 2.4.23, there's a vulnerability in mod_userdir, a module that enables user-specific directories. The issue is akin to a mailbox system that allows someone to insert extra instructions into address labels. This flaw could let attackers split HTTP responses by injecting special characters (CRLF - Carriage Return and Line Feed). It's like manipulating the mailbox to send letters to unintended places. The issue was mitigated in versions 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 by preventing these special characters from being injected, similar to updating the mailbox system to recognize and block these manipulated address labels.
CVE-2016-5387 The issue in Apache HTTP Server up to version 2.4.23 is related to an "httpoxy" vulnerability. It's similar to a postal service that accidentally uses a fake address for sending mail. The server incorrectly trusts data provided by the client in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable. Attackers can exploit this to redirect the server's outbound HTTP traffic to a proxy server they control, like redirecting mail to an address of their choice. This was mitigated in later versions by no longer trusting client data in this way, akin to the postal service verifying addresses before sending mail.
CVE-2016-8612 In Apache HTTP Server mod_cluster before version 2.4.23, there's a vulnerability due to improper input validation in the load balancer's protocol parsing. This is like a mail sorting machine that breaks down when it encounters a letter with incorrect addressing format. The issue causes a segmentation fault, which means the server process handling the requests crashes, similar to the mail sorting machine stopping. This problem is resolved in version 2.4.23 and later, akin to upgrading the machine to handle various addressing formats without malfunctioning.
CVE-2016-8743 In Apache HTTP Server versions prior to 2.2.32 and 2.4.25, there was a lax approach to handling whitespace in requests and responses. This is akin to a mail processing center not being strict about address formats on envelopes. This laxity could lead to security issues in certain configurations, such as when Apache acts as part of a chain of proxies or interacts with backend servers. The problems could include request smuggling, response splitting, and cache pollution, similar to how inconsistent address handling could lead to mail delivery errors. The updates in later versions tighten these whitespace handling rules, much like enforcing stricter address format rules in a mail center.
CVE-2017-15710 In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.0.23 to 2.4.29, there's an issue with mod_authnz_ldap, a module handling authentication via LDAP. Imagine this as a receptionist trying to understand a visitor's accent but only knowing a few languages. The module uses the 'Accept-Language' header to determine the character encoding for verifying user credentials. If the header's language isn't recognized, the system tries a shortened version (like cutting 'en-US' to 'en'). If the language is too short (less than two characters), it incorrectly writes data, potentially causing a crash, similar to the receptionist making a note in the wrong spot in their book. This could lead to a Denial of Service attack. The risk is generally low, as it often doesn't affect the system, like the receptionist's error not always causing an issue.
