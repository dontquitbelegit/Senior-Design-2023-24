Below are the services found running on the computer
A large number of services indicate that this is likely your server or some other important device
The table is ordered like so: (number)/(tcp or udp) (open/closed/blocked) (service name)
The number is what port the service runs on, followed by whether it uses tcp or udp
If the service is turned off so to speak or not accepting users, it will be labelled as closed or blocked
Lastly, the name of the service is at the end. This name is used in CATS vulnerability assessments
