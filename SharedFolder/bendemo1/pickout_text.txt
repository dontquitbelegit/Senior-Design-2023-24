1. Inconclusive Step 1 Failed - First telnet connection to port 21 failed. This means that the following connections will not work and the attack has failed. However, the fact that this first connection did not work should signify that the Server is not working as intended. Please check if the machine is off, if FTP is running, or if a firewall is blocking access.

2. Secure Step 2 Failed - Second telnet connection to port 6200 failed. If the first connection succeeded, but then this one did not, congratulations! The machine is secure against this attack, meaning that either an update has patched this vulnerability or that its otherwise incompatible. The 3rd step will always fail, and if it shows as succeeded, please disregard it and/or send in a bug report!

3. Secure Step 2 Failed - The 'id;' telnet command did not return the user as root. The attack has failed. It is likely that steps 1 or 2 have also failed. In the event that they both passed, this step should not be showing. If steps 1 and 2 did succeed, and this did not, please update your system regardless just in case or check your firewall rules.
